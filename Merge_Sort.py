# Python 3

# Introduction to Merge Sort

# Merge Sort is recursive (method that calls itself).

# Divide-and-conquer algorithm.

# Very efficient for large data sets.

# Merge Sort does log n merge steps because each merge step
# doubles the list size.

# It does n work for each merge step because it must look at
# every item.

# It runs in O(n*logn).
